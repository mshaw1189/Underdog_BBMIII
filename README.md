# Underdog_BBMIII

- The goal of this analysis is to analyze the pick-by-pick data and results of the tournament to identify trends and/or insights of what strategies were successful (or not), which players over/under-performed vs expectation, and any other fun tidbits from the best Best Ball platform out there!

- The data prepared from this process will be used to create an interactive Tableau dashboard that can be viewed via the link below (this is work-in-progress, more updates to come in the dashboard)
